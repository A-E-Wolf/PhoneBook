Purpose: This program implements a single linked list to manage a list of names, locations,
and phone numbers in a manner similar to a telephone directory. The PhonebookNode class
constitutes a single element of the linked list, which contains the node data fields and a
reference to the next node in the list. The PhonebookManager class constructs the list by
adding and modifying nodes. Methods within this class allow nodes to be appended to the end
of the list, added to the list in sorted alphabetical order of the last name data field
of the nodes, and removed when provided a first and last name or an index of a node to be
removed. Other methods return the number of nodes in a list, return a node object when given
an index number or when given a first and last name, modify node data fields, sort a list of
unsorted nodes alphabetically, and return the list in column form. The PhonebookInterface
class provides an interface between the user and the linked list operations, allowing the
user to perform tasks with the linked list. A user may add, edit, and delete contacts, search
for or view all contacts, and re-sort or clear all current contacts. The user may also print
a list of phonebook contacts to a file.
